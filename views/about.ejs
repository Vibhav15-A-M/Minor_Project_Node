                  “The home, away from home” keeping this concept in mind, the hostel was designed to support all the essentials.
                  The NIE boys' hostel which is situated behind the administration block provides all the modern amenities to
                  students for a comfortable stay at the campus. Renovated in August 2018, the hostel has a total area of 72,920
                  sq.ft with four floors and the capacity to accommodate 486 students.
      
                  From an open-air amphitheater for cultural events and celebrations, a fully-equipped gym facility, WiFi access,
                  a common lobby where students can read newspapers and magazines, separate room for watching TV, washing machines
                  on each floor, and hot water geysers with 24 hours water supply. The hostel kitchen is well-stocked and has a
                  multi-cuisine option with a different menu each day. On alternate days, snacks and fruits are available.
      
                  The college has a strict dress code and anti-ragging policy and does not tolerate any action that endangers the
                  well-being of students. In line with this, an anti-ragging squad comprising faculty members from across
                  departments was formed to ensuring student safety and zero ragging activities within the hostel.
